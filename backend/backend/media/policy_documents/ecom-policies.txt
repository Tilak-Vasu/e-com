Welcome to E-Shop (the "Platform"). This document outlines the policies, terms, and conditions governing the use of our services. By creating an account or using the Platform, you agree to abide by these terms. Please read the following sections carefully.

Users must create an account to purchase items or access personalized services like order history and our AI Chat Assistant.

You agree to provide accurate and current information during registration and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

2.2. Product Listings

All product listings on E-Shop are provided with information sourced directly from our suppliers or generated by our AI content systems to ensure clarity.

All products sold are guaranteed to be authentic and new unless explicitly marked otherwise.

E-Shop reserves the right to modify or remove product listings at any time.

Applicable sales taxes are calculated at checkout based on your shipping address.

You will receive an email confirmation upon placing your order and a subsequent email with tracking information once your order has been shipped.

3. Shipping & Delivery
3.1. Shipping Policies

Shipping fees are calculated at checkout based on the items in your cart and the selected shipping destination.

Estimated delivery times are provided for your convenience but are not guaranteed. Delays may occur due to carrier issues or high order volumes.

We cannot ship to P.O. Box addresses.

4. Returns, Refunds, and Cancellations

Customers may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund.

To initiate a return, please contact our support team via the AI Chat Assistant on our website or by emailing support@e-shop.com with your order number.

Items that are defective, damaged, or not as described will be eligible for a return and a full refund, including any shipping costs.

Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days after we receive and inspect the returned item.

Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase.

4.3. Cancellations

Once an order has a tracking number, it cannot be canceled and must be returned according to our Return Policy.

5. Customer Rights and Privacy
5.1. Customer Data Protection

We are committed to protecting your personal information. All data is collected and processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

Your data is never sold to third parties. It is used solely for order processing, personalization features like product recommendations, and to improve our services.

Our primary method for customer support is the AI Chat Assistant available on our website, which can answer questions about your orders and our policies 24/7.

For issues the AI cannot resolve, you can connect with our human support team during business hours through the same chat interface.

6. Prohibited Activities

Users may not use the Platform for any fraudulent or illegal activities.

The creation of multiple accounts for a single user to abuse promotions or policies is strictly prohibited.

Submitting reviews that contain profanity, hate speech, or harassment is forbidden. Our AI moderation system will automatically block such content.
